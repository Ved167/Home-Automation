# Home-Automation

A smart home automation technology that would enable users to automate their home and treat it like a 'JARVIS'. By this system, they will be able to control their homes over a wifi network from any part of the world remotely. This would also ensure security in owner's absence and direct access to our home on our mobile remotely. This system also include voice control facility through which the users can control their homes just by giving voice commands. There is one more way of control, that is self control based on present conditions. The system would check the present conditions and then control the components on its own to make the conditions better. So in short, our smart homw would work by three ways namely, wifi control, voice control and self control to meet optical environment.
